# Charon
Simple macro-based router for Hyper. Early work in progress.

Charon's goal is to be like [structopt](https://docs.rs/structopt/0.3.12/structopt/) but for HTTP routing: routes turn into structs with fields, and from there everything is regular Rust code.

## Usage
See [examples/](examples/) for examples that compile.
